## Overview

This app serves as my personal playground to learn and practice React. Each day or section focuses on an individual concept or mini-app, from basic JSX and components to real-world features like a To-Do List or Calculator.

My goals:

- Strengthen React fundamentals
- Practice hooks, state, forms, and event handling
- Build up to small and medium portfolio-quality projects
- Prepare for job interviews and real-world project work

## Notes

- This app is for rapid, hands-on React learning. Some apps are simple; others may get extended or refactored as I learn.
- Once a mini-app gets big enough, I plan to move it to a new repo for my portfolio and job applications.
- If youâ€™re learning with me, feel free to fork and expand!
